The motivation for this club is to provide workshops and sessions led by students currently on their **Professional Experience Year (PEY)**. We want to offer practical advice and guidance for lower-year students navigating their own paths.

I've always found Industrial Engineering to be a very flexible discipline, but because it's so flexible, the number of available options can sometimes feel overwhelming. My hope is to provide a place where you can learn practical technical skills—at least the ones I've found useful that may not be taught at school—and gain insight into what different career paths for Industrial Engineering really look like.

However, this club isn't just for Industrial Engineering students. We are open to students from all disciplines who are looking to explore their options, especially regarding PEY.

Our plan is to run sessions every 3 weeks, rotating between a technical skills workshop (run by myself or other club members) and a guest speaker session. In these sessions, current PEY students will share what they do, provide advice, and answer questions about their experiences.

This is the first semester we're running this club, so there may be some hiccups along the way. We hope to iterate and improve our sessions to offer the best guidance to lower-year students.

Thanks for reading!
